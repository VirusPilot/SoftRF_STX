## ATTENTION: it is strongly recommended to only use the following open standards based protocols: ADS-L, OGN or FANET
## ATTENTION: only T-Beam, T-Beam S3 Supreme and T-Echo binaries are provided/tested on a regular basis
### It is recommended to consider the following alternatives:
- SoftRF fork with a lot of enhancements: https://github.com/moshe-braner/SoftRF (only for T-Beam up to v1.2 and T-Echo)
- ADS-L/OGN/FANET tracker implementation: https://github.com/pjalocha/ogn-tracker (WIP, only for T-Beam and T-Beam S3 Supreme)

### General Features:
- option to enter `AircraftID` (through SoftRF WiFi settings page: http://192.168.1.1/settings)
  - if added (`AircraftID: <ICAO hex Code>`), then ADDR_TYPE_ICAO is set (this is based on the assumtion that your airplane has a transponder)
  - if **not** added, then the SoftRF factory ID remains (`AircraftID: 0`) and ADDR_TYPE_FLARM is set

### T-Beam and T-Beam S3 Supreme Features:
- **USB mode** (default): enables SoftRF to work as a proper GNSS and Baro source for Stratux
- **Bluetooth LE mode**: enables SoftRF to work as a proper traffic rx/tx and GNSS source for SkyDemon (TestFlight version), please use the following settings:
  - ![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93e70aa7-cf88-4eaa-ad6e-fd0072773417)

### T-Echo Features:
- **Bluetooth LE mode** (default): enables SoftRF to work as a proper traffic rx/tx and GNSS source for SkyDemon (TestFlight version)

## UF2 Binaries
UF2 binaries are available for the following platforms and can be downloaded as part of **`SoftRF.zip`** from here: https://github.com/VirusPilot/SoftRF/actions (click on the latest workflow run and download **`SoftRF.zip`** "Artifact"):

**T-Beam S3 Supreme - UF2 update method** (aka. USB Mass Storage method):
- connect your T-Beam S3 Supreme to your PC and put it in UF2 upload mode (press **RESET** and shortly thereafter **BOOT**)
- upload the `SoftRF.zip/esp32.esp32.esp32s3/SoftRF.ino.uf2` file to the TBEAMBOOT drive, see also: https://github.com/lyusupov/SoftRF/blob/master/software/firmware/binaries/README.md#esp32-s3

**T-Echo - UF2 update method** (aka. USB Mass Storage method):
- connect your T-Echo to your PC and put it in UF2 upload mode (double-click **RESET**)
- upload the `SoftRF.zip/adafruit.nrf52.pca10056/SoftRF.ino.uf2` file to the **NRF52BOOT** or **TECHBOOT** drive that shows up on your PC, see also: https://github.com/lyusupov/SoftRF/blob/master/software/firmware/binaries/README.md#nrf52840

## "classic" Binaries
"classic" binaries are available for the **T-Beam up to v1.2** and can be downloaded as part of **`SoftRF.zip`** from here: https://github.com/VirusPilot/SoftRF/actions (click on the latest workflow run and download **`SoftRF.zip`** "Artifact"):
- connect your T-Beam to your PC (via USB)
- open https://espressif.github.io/esp-launchpad/ with your **Chrome** browser, select "DIY" and "connect" your T-Beam
- it may be necessary the execute "Erase Flash" once
- upload all files from the `SoftRF.zip/esp32.esp32.esp32` folder according to the following order and execute "Program":
![Chrome T-Beam Flash Tool](https://github.com/VirusPilot/SoftRF/assets/43483458/bc84d81f-a71f-46e7-a4d8-c7c2ff45bc2e)

## T-Beam and T-Beam S3 Supreme modifications:
- u-blox GNSS configuration:
  - enable GSA, GSV, VTG, GST
  - enable GPS, GALILEO, BEIDOU and SBAS (u-blox 10 default)
  - enable NMEA extended protocol
- default connection with Stratux: **USB** (115200 baud), the USB T-Beam connection with Stratux works best if `init_uart_baud=115200` is added to the `/boot/config.txt` file on the Raspberry Pi (`/boot/firmware/config.txt` for Bookworm)

## T-Echo modifications:
- L76K GNSS configuration:
  - enable GSA, GSV, VTG
  - enable GPS, GLONASS and BEIDOU
- LK8EX1 messages are disabled

## Limitations:
- GNSS update rate is limited to 1 Hz in SoftRF, which is good enough for Stratux except when using GNSS as a pseudo AHRS (internally all u-blox based T-Beams use 10Hz measurement rate)
- the L76K only supports the NMEA "strict" protocol version, therefore some extended satellite information (like elevation, azimut and numbering) is not provided for some satellites and therefore the GNSS info page in Stratux is incomplete. Furthermore BEIDOU satellites are not displayed at all but are in fact used and counted for "in solution"
- if your T-Beam or T-Echo has a baro sensor (e.g. BMP280) included, you can omit your Stratux baro module as SoftRF is providing the baro altitude to your Stratux

## Recommendations for T-Beam S3 Supreme:
- load OGN database: https://github.com/lyusupov/SoftRF/wiki/Prime-Edition-MkIII.-Aircrafts-database
- modify SoftRF settings (https://github.com/lyusupov/SoftRF/wiki/Settings), using the SoftRF WiFi settings page: http://192.168.1.1/settings

## Recommendations for T-Beam:
- modify SoftRF settings (https://github.com/lyusupov/SoftRF/wiki/Settings), using the SoftRF WiFi settings page: http://192.168.1.1/settings

## Recommendations for T-Echo:
- load OGN database: https://github.com/lyusupov/SoftRF/wiki/Badge-Edition.-Aircrafts-database
- modify SoftRF settings (https://github.com/lyusupov/SoftRF/wiki/Settings) by **downloading** the following scripts, **opening** them in a browser to generate the appropriate $PSRFC and $PSKVC sentences and then **sending** these generated sentences to the SoftRF device via a serial USB console (e.g. Arduino IDE comes with a nice built in serial USB console):
  - https://github.com/VirusPilot/SoftRF/blob/master/software/app/Settings/basic.html (e.g. Protocol, Aircraft type, Aircraft ID)
  - https://github.com/VirusPilot/SoftRF/blob/master/software/app/Settings/ui.html (e.g. Units, e-Paper 'ghosts' removal)
